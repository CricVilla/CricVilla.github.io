<h1>ICC World Test Championship (WTC)</h1>

<p>The <strong>ICC World Test Championship (WTC)</strong> is the international championship for Test cricket, administered by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Launched in 2019, the WTC aims to bring context and excitement to the longest format of cricket by crowning a Test cricket world champion every few years.</p>

<h2>Format</h2>

<p>The WTC follows a league format involving the top nine Test-playing nations. These teams play a series of Test matches against each other over a two-year cycle. Each team plays six series (three home and three away) against selected opponents. The team with the highest points at the end qualifies for the final.</p>

<h2>Points System</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Points are awarded for each match won, tied, drawn, or lost.</li>
  <li>A Test victory earns 12 points, a tie gives 6 points, and a draw awards 4 points.</li>
  <li>Players earn points based on the result of each match, promoting consistent performance.</li>
  <li>Teamsâ€™ rankings are based on their percentage of points won out of the total points contested.</li>
</ul>

<h2>WTC Final</h2>

<p>The top two teams at the end of the league phase face each other in a single final match held at a pre-decided neutral venue. The winner of the final is crowned the ICC World Test Champion.</p>
