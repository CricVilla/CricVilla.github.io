    <h2>Shubman Gill 'Unwell' Days After Asia Cup Squad Announcement</h2>
    <p><small>23 August 2025 | CricVilla News Desk</small></p>
    
    <p>
      Shubman Gill has been in focus for the last couple of months. He was named the 
      Indian cricket team's <strong>Test captain</strong> and excelled in England. Then, there were 
      doubts over his selection for the Asia Cup T20, but he made it through and was 
      named the <strong>vice-captain</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the midst of this, a report has claimed that the 25-year-old Indian cricket 
      team Test captain is likely to miss a major BCCI event, which would have been the 
      top Indian cricket team stars' first event since the England tour.
    </p>

    <p>
      While no official update has been provided by the BCCI yet, fans and experts are 
      waiting eagerly for clarity. Gill’s presence in the Asia Cup would be vital for 
      India’s campaign, given his form and leadership role in recent months.
